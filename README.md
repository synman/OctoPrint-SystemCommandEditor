# Plugin for OctoPrint - makes System Commands editable via settings
====================================================================

This plugin helps you create, edit and delete System commands.
You can Access all option in the settings under "Plugins -> System Command Editor"

Right Click on a Control or the Green Box to open a context menu.

## Setup

Install the plugin via OctoPrint's Plugin Manager, or like you would install any regular Python package from source:

    pip install https://github.com/synman/OctoPrint-SystemCommandEditor/archive/master.zip
    
Make sure you use the same Python environment that you installed OctoPrint under, otherwise the plugin
won't be able to satisfy its dependencies.
